During the implementation stage, Haitaton is used as the service channel for cable reports (application IDs starting with JS) and excavation notifications (application IDs starting with KP). </p> <br /><Puff> <strong>Using the Haitaton service requires a strong authentication.</strong> If you cannot disclose your contact information or use your Helsinki profile for the Haitaton service, please book an appointment with the customer services of the Urban Environment Division (contact information is available on the City of Helsinki website). </Puff> <p> By entering your project in the Haitaton service at as an early stage of the project as possible, the Haitaton system can best help you: </p> <br /> <ul> <li> <strong>manage the detrimental impacts of your project</strong> by, for example, identifying its impacts on factors such as different modes of transport and emissions and by reminding you of related issues that should be agreed in advance </li> <li> <strong>coordinate with other projects added to Haitaton</strong> by, for example, presenting the preliminary space reservation and schedule of your project in the system’s public map section.</li> </ul> <br /> <p>The project you have created in the Haitaton system comprises the project’s general information, as well as the individual project areas, their schedules and their nuisance management plans. For the implementation of the project, applications (cable reports, excavation notifications) are created under the project in Haitaton for authority processing. The applications also have the general information and work areas that need to be included in the project areas in scope and schedule.</p><br /><Puff> <strong> At the moment, the Haitaton system only covers the projects and the works created directly in the system. </strong> As the number of projects and works in Haitaton grows, the coordination within the Haitaton service will also become easier. </Puff> <p> You can give feedback on the Haitaton system by sending an email to <a href=\"mailto:haitaton@hel.fi\">haitaton@hel.fi</a>.

When selecting a project area on the map, the map’s side bar will show the basic information and nuisance index information of the project. The contents and purpose of nuisance indexes have been descripted under the section <a href=”./haittaindeksit”>Nuisance index calculation and nuisance management plan.</a></li> <li><strong>E-services for the public areas</strong>: This section you can have e-services in matters concerning the public areas. You can start by creating a new project. The project becomes public after filling in the mandatory fields of the project form, i.e. it will be shown to other system users. You can then start creating applications (excavation notification, cable report) under the project after this. As the project founder, you will be automatically given all the rights to edit the project. Read more about the project’s access rights in section <a href=”./yhteyshenkilot”>Adding and editing contact information and its access rights</a>.</li> <li><strong>E-services for the private areas</strong>: This section allows you to create an individual cable report application. In connection to this, Haitaton will establish an automatic project template, which only includes the name taken from the cable review as the project information. As the creator of this project template, you will automatically be granted all the rights to edit the project frame. Your cable reports are not shown to other users. However, you can turn this project template into a project by entering the mandatory project information, making the project visible to all the users. This will allow you to also later add other applications to the project in addition to the original cable report.

Performing an index calculation always requires first assessing the lane and emission nuisances of motor traffic for each area drawn in the section under the drawing window.

However, both infrastructure and operating information is received through the interface on tramline updates, which means that the regularly operated tram route sections are updated to the materials in a timely manner.

The events may include an opening ceremony on the worksite’s start date, residents’ evenings and on-call hours at the worksite. </p> <br /> <h3>Outreach work among housing companies, local businesses and residents</h3> <p> Build a communicative connection with the stakeholders around the worksite. Share contact information and talk to people. Emails alone are not enough. Discuss communications with the housing company. Your bulletin could be a letter in the mailbox or on the building’s front door, and later on it can be sent via email if agreed on. It is also recommended to share information in the area’s Facebook groups, if they allow this. Go where the people are and do not assume that they will all follow the channels that you maintain and use to share information. </p> <br /> <h3>Worksite guides</h3> <p> During the first few days of the worksite, the site should have guides dressed in yellow vests. The guides will provide guidance for residents, answer their questions and distribute maps of the worksite area. </p> <br /> <h3>Instant messaging notifications</h3> <p> In challenging locations, you can use subscribed notifications via SMS or an instant messaging service as agreed on. Many worksites have a WhatsApp group where worksite schedules and status information are shared at least once a week. If WhatsApp or similar channels are used for worksite communication, this needs to be stated on the worksite’s information board. </p> <br /> <h3>Presentation of the worksite</h3> <p> The worksite can be presented more extensively with the help of a container or a wall. The presentation entity should include more details about the work being done and its stages, special qualities and plans. The presentation should also include the planned results of the worksite and their effects on residents. </p> <br /> <h3>Person responsible for communications and/or social media team </h3> <p>The person responsible for worksite communications is a person appointed to this task by the contractor. This person will be closely involved in the everyday work and meetings of the worksite. They will implement the worksite’s communications plan in co-operation with the client’s communications and other parties. When an individual is specifically in charge of communications, the communications from the worksite to the residents will be functional and up-to-date. Consider establishing a social media team for larger worksites with significant impacts. Communications should be considered especially carefully when a worksite has significant impact. </p> <br /> <h3>Communications campaign for the worksite</h3> <p>A worksite with a significant impact needs to involve a plan for a communications campaign that can make use of the digital advertisement boards in the city, or the contractor’s own digital screens in the worksite area and its vicinity. The methods, duration and scope of the communications campaign should be agreed on with the client. </p> <br /> <h3>Traffic announcements can also be shared in the newsfeed of Helsingin Uutiset</h3> <p> Contact the service at: <a href=\"https://oma.media.fi/lehti/helsingin-uutiset/yhteystiedot/laheta-juttuvinkki/\"> Send a news tip to Helsingin Uutiset (in Finnish)</a> </p>",
